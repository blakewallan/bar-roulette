Bar Roulette V2 is a cross platform mobile application built using Ionic. Bar Roulette finds all open bars within a selectable distance from the user and selects one by random. It shows the user the price to take an Uber, or the time and distance to drive or walk. The bars name is not revealed until the user is close to the bar. 

Bar Roulette uses the Uber API, Google Maps API and Google Places API.
